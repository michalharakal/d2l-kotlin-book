# Dive into Deep Learning (Kotlin version)

**WIP**

This project is modified from the original [Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai) book by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, Alex J. Smola and all the community contributors. 
GitHub of the original book: [https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en). 
We have adapted the book to to use Kotlin and the [SKaiNET](https://skainet.sk).

All the notebook here can be downloaded and run using [Kotlin Kernel](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter) .
